Follow me as I follow along [Carrei's](https://www.kaggle.com/carrie1) analysis of Kaggle's ecommerce data set. 

I would like to go back through and find out why my seaborn package didn't produce any images, yet time to get back to 
my actual homework. Thanks for tuning in! 

Note that the data is too large for github to handle.
